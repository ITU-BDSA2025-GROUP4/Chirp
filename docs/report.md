## How to make Chirp! work locally
Ensure that the following dependencies are installed.

`dotnet-runtime 8.0`
`asp-runtime 8.0`
`sqlite3`

## How to run test suite locally

The simplest way to run all unit tests is to simply execute the helper script
`scripts/run_all_tests.sh` like so.

```
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh
```

Alternatively, tests can be run individually by navigating to the appropriate
unit test directory inside the `test` directory and running the .NET test
command.

```
dotnet test
```
